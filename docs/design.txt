Implementation Strategy
=======================

Virtual Machine
---------------

The virtual machine is a Linux process running under ptrace(). Instructions 
or addressing not implemented in the host architecture are implemented as
"system calls" or "illegal instructions" and are trapped by prtrace() which
delivers them to the parent process for emulation.

These operations are of the type:

   Copy memory from/to current segment and another segment.
   Transfer control to a different segment (call6, ret).
   Page faults, directed faults.

Code Generation
---------------

Strategy 1: The Multics 'pl1' compiler is modified to generate host (x86 or
ARM, eg), and then recompiles itself to the host. The needed parts of 
pl1_operators_ is is hand translated to the host.

Strategy 2: Mind Springs PL/I is used to rebuild Multics on the host. (But
it is a closed compiler; can 'segments' be usefully implemented?)

Strategy 3: Another PL/I compiler is used. ($$$).

Strategy 4: Multics is translated to a supported language.
